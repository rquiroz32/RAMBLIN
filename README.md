# Summary
This was an assignment in my coding bootcamp course from Rutgers. We were required to create a quiz game that kept track of the user's score, had a timer that deducted time for every wrong answer, and had a high score with a leader board. It really showed me what's possible with on click events and how to dynamically apply styles to elements on a page. This dynamic styling let me pre-create a lot of what I needed and show/hide it as that part of the quiz came up. Definitely a great excercise that taught me a lot.
